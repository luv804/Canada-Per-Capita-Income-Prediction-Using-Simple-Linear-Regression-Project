# Simple Linear Regression Project
## Canada Per Capita Income Prediction Using Simple Linear Regression
### Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a statistical model that estimates the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The case of one independent variable is called Simple Linear Regression
### The Problem Statement
Despite the importance of per capita income as an economic indicator, forecasting its future values can be challenging due to the influence of various factors, including economic growth, inflation rates, employment levels, and demographic changes. This project aims to predict the per capita income of Canada using simple linear regression. By analyzing historical income data and other relevant factors, we can develop a predictive model that offers insights into economic trends and helps policymakers make informed decisions.
